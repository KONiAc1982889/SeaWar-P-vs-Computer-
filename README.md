# SeaWar-P-vs-Computer-

SeaWar-P-vs-Computer is a text-based game inspired by the classic board game Battleship.
The game features a player vs. computer setup, where the player and computer each have a set of ships, and they take turns attacking each other's fleets.
I used CodeBlocks IDE for running and compiling the C++ source code, I used structs and functions.
